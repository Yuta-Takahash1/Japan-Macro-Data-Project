# Japan-Macro-Data-Project

In this website, with help of anonymous macroeconomists, we plan to gather all the public data which is useful for analyzing the Japanese macroeconomy.

E-stat (https://www.e-stat.go.jp) is nice, but not perfect.
For example, some statistics are only coded in Japanese. Some data is posted on the web, but we cannnot access from E-stat.
So, we make a platform.
